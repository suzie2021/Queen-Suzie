      <p style="color: aqua;"> Hello!!!! My name is Nakimuli Mary Susan alias Suzie Pinky Panther.Am an underway electrical engineer who is just at a diploma level pursuing mai studies here in kampala Uganda.
           Never in my life had i dreamt about being a software or web developer.But my fate changed when i happened to find a role model- my brother Kawesa Nasser.
           He built my passion of being a web developer. Earlier this year he introduced me to a program called CODE QUEEN which is orgainsed by the Innovation Village Ntinda Uganga.
           I did sign up for the course which is supposed to last abt 2 months. There i got to meet amazing ladies and gents to learn from.
        <p style="color: aqua;"> 
            We are two weeks down the road and so far so good. I joined this platform and trust me when i say i have learnt new things and am still learning. Guys we are in evolving world.
            I joined with zero skills and no techincal background but i trust the process slowly but surely i will be at the top.
